**Prompt:** Summarize this project: a Flask Shipment Manager app with auth and CRUD  
**Gemini CLI Response File:** `docs/gemini_outputs/test_response.json`  
**Summary of Response (short excerpt):**  
>This is a web application for managing shipments, built with the **Flask** framework in Python. It allows users to register and log in to manage a list of shipments.\n\nKey features include:\n\n*   **User Authentication**: It has a complete user authentication system using **Flask-Login**, allowing users to register, log in, and log out. Routes that manage shipments are protected and require a user to be logged in.\n*   **Full CRUD Functionality**: The application implements all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for shipments:\n    *   **Create**: Users can add new shipments with details like description, status, cost, and fragility.\n    *   **Read**: It displays a paginated list of all shipments, which can be filtered by status (e.g., Pending, In-Transit, Delivered). Users can also view the details of a single shipment.\n    *   **Update**: Existing shipments can be edited.\n    *   **Delete**: Shipments can be removed from the system.\n*   **Database**: The application uses **Flask-SQLAlchemy** as an ORM to interact with a **SQLite** database (`shipsy.db`). It defines two main database models: `User` and `Shipment`.\n*   **Calculated Fields**: The `Shipment` model includes a calculated `total_cost` property, which is dynamically computed from the base cost, tax rate, and handling fee.\n*   **Configuration**: It uses a `.env` file to manage configuration settings like the application's secret key.\n\nThe main application logic, routes, and database models are defined in `app.py`, and it renders HTML from the `templates/` directory. The `openapi.yaml` file suggests that it may also be designed to expose a RESTful API."

**What I changed because of this:**  
Added a summary of the project in `/docs/README_assignment.md` to describe overall purpose clearly.
